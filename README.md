# megaLib
megaLib is a Python library for the [Megaport RESTful API](https://dev.megaport.com/).

[Megaport](https://www.megaport.com/) operates a global, Software Defined Network which enables their customers to 
manage their connectivity in close to real time.

The Megaport API allows customers to interact with their account in the same way as they might using the GUI (in the 
form of a Web [Portal](https://portal.megaport.com/login)). This Python library provides functions for all the core 
actions one might perform using the API.

## Who Uses megaLib
Anyone who has an existing Megaport account and would like to automate Megaport things in Python. If you don't have an 
account you can [signup here](https://portal.megaport.com/signup).

## How it Works
megaLib is a library which you can call upon in your code. Using the same 
[public API for Megaport](https://api.megaport.com/), megaLib simplifies your next Mega Project in Python.

If you would like more information on the Megaport API I suggest checking out the 
[Megaport API documentation](https://dev.megaport.com/) and the 
[Megaport Knowledgebase Articles](https://knowledgebase.megaport.com/open-api/) on the API.
