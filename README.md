[Megaport](https://www.megaport.com/) operates a global, Software Defined Network which enables their customers to 
manage their connectivity in close to real time. The Megaport API allows customers to interact with their account in 
the same way as they might using the [Web Portal](https://portal.megaport.com/login).

## Who Uses megaLib
Anyone who has an existing Megaport account and would like to automate Megaport things in Python. If you don't have an 
account you can [signup here](https://portal.megaport.com/signup).

## How it Works
megaLib is a wrapper for the Megaport API which uses the [public API for Megaport](https://api.megaport.com/), 
simplifying your next Mega Project in Python.

If you would like more information on the Megaport API I suggest checking out the 
[Megaport API documentation](https://dev.megaport.com/) and the 
[Megaport Knowledgebase Articles](https://knowledgebase.megaport.com/open-api/) on the API.
