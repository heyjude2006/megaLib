# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue before making a 
change. Please note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/jvdspeare/megaLib/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), we 
ask that you follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Questions
The GitHub issue tracker is for *bug reports*, *feature requests* and *questions*. Make sure that your question is 
tagged with the `question` label, to ensure that it is answered promptly.

## Good Bug Reports
Please be aware of the following things when filing bug reports:

1. Avoid raising duplicate issues. *Please* use the GitHub issue search feature to check whether your bug report or 
   feature request has been mentioned in the past.
2. When filing bug reports about exceptions or tracebacks, please include the *complete* traceback. Partial tracebacks, 
    or just the exception text, are not helpful.
3. Make sure you provide a suitable amount of information to work with. This means you should provide:

   - Guidance on **how to reproduce the issue**. Ideally, this should be a *small* code sample that can be run 
     immediately by the maintainers. Failing that, let us know what you're doing, how often it happens, what environment 
     you're using, etc. Be thorough: it prevents us needing to ask further questions.
   - Tell us **what you expected to happen**. When we run your example code, what are we expecting to happen? What does 
     "success" look like for your code?
   - Tell us **what actually happens**. It's not helpful for you to say "it doesn't work" or "it fails". Tell us *how* 
     it fails: do you get an exception? A hang? A non-200 status code? How was the actual result different from your 
     expected result?
   - Tell us **what version of megaLib you're using**, and **how you installed it**. Different versions of megaLib 
     behave differently and have different bugs.

   If you do not provide all of these things, it will take us much longer to fix your problem. If we ask you to clarify 
   these and you never respond, we will close your issue without fixing it.

## How to Contribute
1.  Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
2.  Fork [the repository](https://github.com/jvdspeare/megaLib) on GitHub to start making your changes to the master 
    branch (or branch off of it).
3.  Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature
    works as expected.
4.  Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published.
