# megaLib
megaLib is a Python library for the [Megaport API](https://dev.megaport.com/). The Megaport API allows customers to 
interact with their account in the same way as they might using the GUI (in the form of a Web 
[Portal](https://portal.megaport.com/login)). This Python library provides functions for all the core actions one might 
perform using the API.

## Who Uses megaLib
Anyone who has an existing Megaport account and would like to automate Megaport things in Python. If you don't have an 
account go [signup](https://portal.megaport.com/signup).

## How it Works
megaLib is a library which you can call upon in your code. Using the same 
[public API for Megaport](https://api.megaport.com/), megaLib simplifies your next Mega Project in Python.

If you would like more information on the Megaport API I suggest checking out the 
[Megaport API documentation](https://dev.megaport.com/) or the 
[Megaport Knowledgebase Articles](https://knowledgebase.megaport.com/open-api/) on the API.

## Usage
You can find examples for every function [here](https://github.com/jvdspeare/megaLib/tree/master/examples). If that's 
not enough additional resources can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/jvdspeare/megaLib/wiki).
